## What tools are benchmarked by BurntSushi

<blockquote>

* **ripgrep** (rg) (v0.1.2) - You’ve heard enough about this one already.
* **GNU grep** (v2.25) - Ol’ reliable.
* **git grep** (v2.7.4) - Like grep, but built into git. Only works well in git repositories.
* **The Silver Searcher** (ag) (commit cda635, using PCRE 8.38) - Like ack, but written in C and much faster. Reads your .gitignore files just like ripgrep.
* **Universal Code Grep** (ucg) (commit 487bfb, using PCRE 10.21 with the JIT enabled) - Also like ack but written in C++, and only searches files from a whitelist, and doesn’t support reading .gitignore.
* **The Platinum Searcher** (pt) (commit 509368) - Written in Go and does support .gitignore files.
sift (commit 2d175c) - Written in Go and supports .gitignore files with an optional flag, but generally prefers searching everything (unlike every other tool in this list except for grep).

Notably absent from this list is ack. I chose not to benchmark it because, at the time of writing, ack was much slower than the other tools in this list. However, ack 3 is now in beta and includes some performance improvements, sometimes decreasing search times by half.

## Reproducing

Setting up the benchmark data
```sh
cd /path/to/UT3-BE-search-perf

# Setting up benchmark code
mkdir external
cd external
git clone https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep.git

# Fix for subtitles file with a wrong name
mkdir -p rg-benchsuite-data/subtitles
cd rg-benchsuite-data/subtitles
curl -LO https://object.pouta.csc.fi/OPUS-OpenSubtitles/v2016/mono/en.txt.gz
gunzip en.txt.gz
mv en.txt en.sample.txt
cd ../../

# Download the rest of the benchmark
./ripgrep/benchsuite/benchsuite --dir rg-benchsuite-data --download all
```

Running the full suite and write the raw data to csv
```sh
./ripgrep/benchsuite/benchsuite --dir rg-benchsuite-data --raw rg-benchsuite-results.csv
```
